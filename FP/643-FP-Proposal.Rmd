# Introduction

Web-based music streaming services such as __Spotify__, __Pandora__, __SoundCloud__, and __Tidal__ provide their users with many opportunities to discover new music, whether in the form of specific pieces of music the user hadn't heard before or in the form of musical artists to which the user hasn't previously been exposed. These systems make use of tools such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering as part of their efforts to further engage their user base. Given the widespread use of such methodologies for enabling the discovery of new music, today's web-based streaming environment offers ample opportunity for those interested in exploring both the methods typically used for constructing recommender systems and how such systems can effectively be applied to enable the discovery of novel content.

# Problem Formulation & Objectives

The purpose of this project will be to implement a multi-faceted approach to musical artist recommendations through the use of a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm, similarity matrices, content-based filtering, and an interactive application interface. The goal of the project will be to gain experience in the implemention of a variety of recommendation algorithms using a large (1M+ item) data set and to gain insight into how many commercial recommender systems enable "user discovery" of different content. Additionally, this project will provide the authors with hands-on experience in implementing an interactive user interface within a combined collaborative/content-based recommender system framework.

# Approach

The project will be implemented using __R__ / __RStudio__, __Shiny__, __Github__, and the __last.fm__ publicly available dataset of system user, musical artist, and user-supplied music genre labelings. A "Top N" user-based collaborative filter, artist-genre matrix, and artist similarity matrix will each be constructed within __R__. The collaborative filter will be constructed using the __recommenderlab__ toolset and will generated a "Top N" list of recommended artists for each __last.fm__ user. The resulting data structure being saved within an __RData__ file and uploaded to __Github__ for use within an envisioned Shiny application. Similarly, the artist similarity and artist-genre matrices will also be saved as __RData__ files and uploaded to __Github__ for use within an envisioned __Shiny__ application.

An envisioned __Shiny__ application will allow a prospective __last.fm__ user to do each of the following:

1. Review the list of artists to which they've previously listened;

2. View the "Top 10" artist recommendations generated by the user-based collaborative filtering recommender system;

3. Receive a "Top 5" list of suggested of musical artists who are likely similar to an artist specified/selected by the user;

4. Receive a "Top 5" list of suggested of artists for a user-selected musical genre.

5. For any artist listed in the results of items 1, 2, 3, or 4 (above), the user will be able to simply select the artist's name and click an icon to activate item 3, thereby generating a new "Top N" list of suggested musical artists who are likely similar to the selected artist.

A mockup of the envisioned __Shiny__ interface is shown below.

# Data to be Used

The data set to be used is comprised of music listening information for a set of 1,892 users of the __Last.fm__ online music system. The data set is contained within a series of text files, the following of which will be used as part of this project:

__tags.dat__: This file contains a list of musical genres that __last.fm__ users have used to categorize the various musical artists represented within the __last.fm__ online music streaming platform. Each genre is assigned a unique identifier, or "tagID". The following sample of data from the __tags.dat__ file shows that each musical genre and unique tagID pair is provided in a separate row, with the data values delineated by spaces: 

tagID	tagValue  
1	metal  
2	alternative metal  
3	goth rock  
4	black metal  
5	death metal  


__artists.dat__: This file contains a list of musical artists available within the __last.fm__ platform. Each artist is assigned a unique identifier, or "artistID". Furthermore, a URL to a webpage for the artist as well as a second URL to a photo of the artist are provided. For purposes of this project, we will not make use of either of the two URLs.

The structure of the file is as follows:

id	name	url	pictureURL

As with the __tags.dat__ file, items within the file are separated by spaces.

__user_artists.dat__: This file lists the artists to which each user has listened and also provides a "listen count" for each [user, artist] pair. A total of 17,632 distinct musical artists are represented within the data set, resulting in a total of 92,834 [user-listened artist] pairs.

The file sample below shows that each user is assigned a unique ID, and the artists to which they have listened are represented by their respective artistID's. The number of times a user has listened to an artist is represented by the value contained within the "weight" column.

userID	artistID	weight  
2	51	13883  
2	52	11690  
2	53	11351  
2	54	10300  
2	55	8983  

__user_taggedartists.dat__: This file contains a listing of each instance in which a __last.fm__ user has assigned a musical genre label (a.k.a., a "tag") to an artist. The file also contains the date (day, month, and year) of the "tagging". As can be seen in the small file sample below, each user can apply more than one genre label to any given artist.

userID	artistID	tagID	day	month	year  
2	52	13	1	4	2009  
2	52	15	1	4	2009  
2	52	18	1	4	2009  
2	52	21	1	4	2009  
2	52	41	1	4	2009  
2	63	13	1	4	2009  

The date components of the file will not be made use of for this project.

# Combining the Data

We envision combining the data contained within these various files in different ways to enable our proposed application:

1. Content from __artists.dat__ and __user_artists.dat__ will serve as the basis of the proposed "Top N" collaborative filter;

2. Content from __tags.dat__, __user_taggedartists.dat__, and __artists.dat__ will serve as the basis of a artist-genre matrix;

3. Content from __tags.dat__, __user_taggedartists.dat__, and __artists.dat__ will serve as the basis of an "artist similarity" matrix and related "Top N" similar artists list.

By combining the data in such ways, we hope to be able to provide the users of our envisioned __Shiny__ application with a variety of ways in which to discover new music.
